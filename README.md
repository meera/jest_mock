# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Author: <meera.datey@gmail.com>

This project is created to simulate
[Jest Manual Mock does not work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65108082/jest-manual-mocks-does-not-use-mock-file-in-cra) problem.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test.cli`

I didn't get npm run test to work - had to use --no-watchman flag to get tests to run.
